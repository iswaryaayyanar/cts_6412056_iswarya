Step 1: Creating the CUSTOMERS table
CREATE TABLE customers (
    customer_id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    name        VARCHAR2(100),
    age         NUMBER
);

Step 2: Creating the LOANS table
CREATE TABLE loans (
    loan_id        NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id    NUMBER,
    loan_amount    NUMBER,
    interest_rate  NUMBER(5,2),
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)
);

Step 3: Inserting New Sample Data into CUSTOMERS
INSERT INTO customers VALUES (10, 'Anil Kumar', 68);
INSERT INTO customers VALUES (11, 'Beena Rani', 52);
INSERT INTO customers VALUES (12, 'Mohan Das', 73);

Step 4: Inserting New Sample Data into LOANS
INSERT INTO loans VALUES (201, 10, 400000, 9.25);
INSERT INTO loans VALUES (202, 11, 250000, 7.75);
INSERT INTO loans VALUES (203, 12, 300000, 8.60);

Step 5: PL/SQL block to reduce interest rate for senior citizens
DECLARE
    CURSOR senior_loan_cursor IS
        SELECT loan_id, interest_rate
        FROM loans
        WHERE customer_id IN (
            SELECT customer_id FROM customers WHERE age > 60
        );

    loan_details senior_loan_cursor%ROWTYPE;

BEGIN
    OPEN senior_loan_cursor;
    LOOP
        FETCH senior_loan_cursor INTO loan_details;
        EXIT WHEN senior_loan_cursor%NOTFOUND;

        UPDATE loans
        SET interest_rate = loan_details.interest_rate - 1
        WHERE loan_id = loan_details.loan_id;

        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Revised interest for Loan #' || loan_details.loan_id ||
                             ' | Previous: ' || loan_details.interest_rate ||
                             ' | Updated: ' || (loan_details.interest_rate - 1));
    END LOOP;
    CLOSE senior_loan_cursor;

    COMMIT;
END;
