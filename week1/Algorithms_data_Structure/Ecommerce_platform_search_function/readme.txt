Time Complexity
Linear Search:
Best Case: O(1) — when the element is at the beginning

Average Case: O(n)

Worst Case: O(n) — when the element is not found or at the end

Binary Search (only on sorted data):
Best Case: O(1) — when the middle element is the target

Average Case: O(log n)

Worst Case: O(log n)
